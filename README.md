1. Project Overview
Goals:
Develop a simulator that demonstrates CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling).

Provide real-time visualization of Gantt charts and performance metrics (Average Waiting Time, Turnaround Time).

Allow users to input processes dynamically (arrival time, burst time, priority).

Optimize scheduling using intelligent heuristics (if extending to ML).

Expected Outcomes:
Interactive GUI for entering processes.

Real-time Gantt chart visualization.

Calculation and display of scheduling performance metrics.

Potential for an AI-powered enhancement (optional).

Scope:
Core implementation: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling.

Data visualization: Dynamic Gantt charts and performance graphs.

User interface: Interactive, easy-to-use input forms.

2. Module-Wise Breakdown
1. User Interface (GUI)
Purpose: Provides an interactive interface to enter processes and display results.

2. Scheduling Algorithms & Logic
Purpose: Implements FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling logic, calculates metrics.

3. Data Visualization & Performance Analysis
Purpose: Generates real-time Gantt charts, computes waiting time, and displays statistics.

3. Functionalities
Module 1: User Interface (GUI)
Input Form: Users enter arrival time, burst time, priority, and time quantum (for RR).

Start/Reset Button: Start simulation and reset inputs.

Algorithm Selection: Dropdown to select a scheduling algorithm.

Example: A user selects "Round Robin", enters time quantum = 2, clicks "Run".

Module 2: Scheduling Algorithms & Logic
Implementation of FCFS, SJF, RR, and Priority Scheduling.

Process Execution Simulation: Simulates CPU execution with time progression.

Performance Metric Calculation:

Average Waiting Time: 
𝐴
𝑊
𝑇
=
∑
(
𝑊
𝑇
)
Total Processes
AWT= 
Total Processes
∑(WT)
​
 

Turnaround Time: 
𝑇
𝐴
𝑇
=
Completion Time
−
Arrival Time
TAT=Completion Time−Arrival Time

Example: A process arrives at time 0 with burst time 5, another at time 2 with burst 3. The simulator calculates completion order.

Module 3: Data Visualization & Performance Analysis
Gantt Chart Visualization: Displays CPU execution over time.

Performance Metrics Display: Shows Avg. WT, Avg. TAT, and CPU utilization.

Real-time Updates: Animates process execution dynamically.

Example: A user runs "Priority Scheduling", and a real-time Gantt chart appears.
